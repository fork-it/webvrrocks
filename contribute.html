### Which types of WebVR sites may I submit?

We'll take any and all genres of WebVR experiences: animation, 3D, film, video, narrative, experimentalâ€¦ if you can make it happen, you can share it.

### What's in it for me?

The [WebVR Rocks Showcase](https://webvr.rocks/showcase) is an opportunity to showcase your own style and form of expression. It is an excuse to do something that is non-commercial-based, non-client-based work. It is an exercise in your own creativity.
